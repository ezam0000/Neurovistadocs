The primary goal of NeuroVista is to develop an AI-powered web application that assists healthcare professionals in diagnosing and treating a wide range of health conditions. The system acts as a sophisticated diagnostic tool, leveraging artificial intelligence to analyze patient data and generate multiple potential diagnostic and treatment options.

Key Components and Workflow:

1. Data Capture:
   - Capture detailed patient symptoms and medical history through the PatientForm component.
   - Future integration with electronic health records (EHRs), lab results, and imaging reports.

2. Data Processing and AI Analysis:
   - Utilize AWS Comprehend Medical for natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant medical information.
   - Apply machine learning algorithms to analyze the processed data, considering symptom patterns and medical history.

3. Multi-Solution Generation:
   - Generate MULTIPLE potential diagnostic solutions based on the AI analysis.
   - Each solution includes:
     a) Potential diagnosis
     b) Confidence level
     c) Supporting evidence from the patient data
     d) Suggested additional tests or examinations
     e) Potential treatment options

4. Doctor's Decision Support:
   - Present generated solutions in a clear, intuitive interface (AIAnalysisResults component).
   - Allow doctors to compare different diagnostic possibilities and treatment options.

5. Solution Refinement:
   - Implement a "funnel" approach where doctors can select the most promising solutions.
   - Allow for iterative refinement based on doctor's input.

6. Treatment Plan Formulation:
   - Assist in formulating a final treatment plan based on the selected diagnosis.
   - Provide evidence-based treatment recommendations.

7. Continuous Learning:
   - Incorporate feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement of AI capabilities (planned).

8. Reporting and Documentation:
   - Generate comprehensive reports detailing the diagnostic process (in progress).

9. Integration and Interoperability:
   - Ensure seamless integration with existing hospital information systems (planned).
   - Implement secure data exchange protocols for patient privacy.

The ultimate goal of NeuroVista is to enhance the diagnostic process by:
- Reducing the likelihood of missed or delayed diagnoses
- Providing doctors with a broader range of well-supported diagnostic possibilities
- Streamlining the process of considering and evaluating different treatment options
- Improving patient outcomes through more accurate and timely diagnoses and treatments
- Serving as a powerful learning tool for medical professionals

NeuroVista aims to become an indispensable tool in modern healthcare, augmenting the capabilities of medical professionals and ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes.
